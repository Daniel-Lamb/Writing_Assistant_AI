# About

This is a Writing Assistant powered by AI21 Labs, made with React and Tailwind. It has the ability to summarize a website, check grammar, improve your writing, and generate new text. This was my first time working with Large Language Model APIs, and I learned a lot from this project. If you want to try it out, see Set Up below:
